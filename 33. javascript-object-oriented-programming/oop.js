/*

   Object oriented programming -> Organizes and models data and behavior using objects and classes.
   
   4 parts of OOPS -> Constructor, Prototype, Class, Instances (this)

   4 pillars :
   Abstraction -> focuses on hiding complex part and gives required output
   Encapsulation -> bundling/ wrapping data
   Inheritance -> to create a new class from an existing class
   Polymorphism -> Ability to use a single interface to represent different underlying forms


   Object Literals is similar as like a normal object
